Programming for Data Analysis
Assignment 2018
DATE DUE ON/BEFORE 11 NOV 2018

This is a log file created to track/record activity related to the assignment.


FOR INFO:
The .LOG at the top will cause NOTEPAD to auto-insert the date and time on a new line when the file is opened. This is handy for keeping track of the date&time.

Not much logging done this time.
Used code from the FUND-in-D-A to do this section which itself used code from last semesters project code.
So most of the activity for creatign most of the code was doen last semester even though I didnt know it at the time.

Used the reference area to record some activity.

After all this activity, I can see why the number of bookshops is dwindling.
The two books I bought have only been opened twice - the rest has been off the internet
and if I looked hard enough I could probably find the books as a downlaodable PDF.
